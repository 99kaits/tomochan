![silly mario banner that says "i am a placeholder: SUPER MARIO BANNER" and the picture is a bunch of fucked up marios in gm_construct](static/banners/placeholderbanner.png)
# tomochan

some type of imageboard (images not implemented yet) using python/flask, and sqlite

TODO:
- file uploads, 3 images by default maybe? also multiple images in the form, also videso and audio probably
- post formatting of some variety (im thinking markdown, and maybe a selector for classical formatting)
- aesthetics
- board page showing last 5 threads
- maybe some other email easter eggs besides sage and nonoko?
- combined sage and nonoko, gotta add that but idk what the thing to combine them is because im at the library and i dont want to open 4chan at the library right now
- reply button on threads on the board view too
- other pages, maybe an /ukko/ or homepage or rules/faq or whatever
- funny 404 pages
- board specific banners
- oekaki would be so epic just imagine
- caching rendered templates for extra performance maybe?
- config file
- init scripts
- mod view/tools
- mobile, just mobile
- qol javascript stuff?
- boardlist/info in db maybe? maybe not?
- maybe an eventual rewrite with kotlin/postgres?????? idk?????????

DONE:
- posting
- displaying posts
- saving posts (NOT using pickle im using sqlite now)
- something better for timestamps
- swatch internet time
- sql db of some type
- threads
- replies
- post ids
- sage and nonoko (im going for modern 4ch behavior there its just actually better defaulting to noko)


markdown things:
- discord style newlines, its just better esp for this kinda thing
- no embedding images sorry you got the file uploader for that
- fancy links will DEFINITELY be toggleable for sure just imagine the abuse cases
