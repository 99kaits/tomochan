# tomochan

some type of imageboard (images not implemented yet) using python/flask, and sqlite

TODO:
- file uploads
- post formatting of some variety (im thinking markdown, and maybe a selector for classical formatting)
- aesthetics
- board page showing last 5 threads
- maybe some other email easter eggs besides sage and nonoko?
- combined sage and nonoko, gotta add that but idk what the thing to combine them is because im at the library and i dont want to open 4chan at the library right now
- reply button on threads on the board view too
- other pages, maybe an /ukko/ or homepage or rules/faq or whatever
- funny 404 pages
- board specific banners
- maybe an eventual rewrite with kotlin/postgres??????

DONE:
- posting
- displaying posts
- saving posts (NOT using pickle im using sqlite now)
- something better for timestamps
- swatch internet time
- sql db of some type
- threads
- replies
- post ids
- sage and nonoko (im going for modern 4ch behavior there its just actually better defaulting to noko)
